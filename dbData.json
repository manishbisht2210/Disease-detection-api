		    "A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit.Â ",
			"The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves",
			"Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface",
			"Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early in the summer",
			"Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center",
			"As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky",
			"Â Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms.Â ",
			"Severely affected fruit may drop, especially when young.",
			"The disease usually noticed on leaves and fruits.",
			"Affected leaves become twisted or puckered and have black, circular spots on their upper surface.",
			"On the under surface of leaves, the spots are velvety and may coalesce to cover the whole leaf surface. Severely affected leaves may turn yellow and drop.",
			"Scab can also infect flower stems and cause flowers to drop.",

	   "remedies": [
			"Choose resistant varieties when possible.",
			"Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.",
			"Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.",
			"Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores.",
			"For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop.",
			"BonideÂ® Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest.",
			"OrganocideÂ® Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.",
			"Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, BonideÂ® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots."

			"Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark and cankers, itâ€™s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. ",
			"During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches beyond the wound. ",
			"Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. ",
			"Once black rot disease is under control in your tree and youâ€™re again harvesting healthy fruits, make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Although general purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores."

			"The â€œsmudgeâ€� appearance results from the presence of hundreds of minute, dark pycnidia that are interconnected by a mass of loose, interwoven dark hyphae.",

			"Prevention is a lot simpler than you probably imagine. Sooty blotch appears when temperatures are warming and humidity is high, so removing one of those factors can stop this disease in its tracks. Of course, you canâ€™t control the weather, but you can control the humidity in the canopy of your tree. ",
			"Sooty blotch on apples is primarily a problem of under pruned trees, so get in there and prune that apple tree like mad",

			"It may feel counter-intuitive to prune a fruit tree, but at the end of the day, it can only support so many fruits, no matter how many branches it has. ",
			"Removing excess branches not only increases air circulation, preventing the build-up of humidity, but it allows the fruits that remain to grow larger. ",
			"Thinning fruits soon after they begin to swell is another way to help keep sooty blotch down. ",
			"Remove every second fruit to prevent fruits from touching and creating microclimates where sooty blotch can thrive",

			"As spots age, they often turn tan to ash gray. Some spots undergo secondary enlargement, becoming irregularly shaped.",
			"Heavily infected leaves often abscise, resulting in defoliation. (Defoliation is greater when mites are present.) Fruit infections result in small, dark, raised pimple-like lesions associated with the lenticels.",

			"Liquid copper fungicides such as Monterey Liqui-Cop or Bonide Liquid Copper Fungicide are extremely effective for control of many fungal diseases including alternaria. Apply every 7-10 days as needed to reduce fungal growth and spread.",
			"If applied up to 2 weeks prior to when alternaria normally appears in your garden, these liquid copper fungicides can completely prevent the spread entirely!",
			"A sulfur-based plant fungicide can also help. Cover both the tops and bottoms of leaves with a thin layer of a sulfur-based powder like Bonide Sulfur Plant Fungicide. The sulfur prohibits fungal propagation.",
			"Broad-spectrum organic options for fungal control, such as Serenade Garden, will also have great effect. This product uses Bacillus subtilis to effectively control a wide variety of fungal plant disease, including powdery mildew, alternaria, anthracnose, and more.",
			"Finally, pests can carry fungi between plants, too. A good preventative for many pest types is neem oil. While it will not control all pests, it often makes for an inhospitable environment for pests to live in, making it less likely theyâ€™ll spread disease."
